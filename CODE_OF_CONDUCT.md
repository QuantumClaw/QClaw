# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be decent. Help each other. Don't be a prat.

## The Longer Version

We want QuantumClaw to be a welcoming project for everyone, regardless of experience level, background, identity, or how they write their code.

**Do:**
- Be kind and constructive in reviews and discussions
- Assume good intent
- Help newcomers. Everyone was new once.
- Give credit where it's due
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully

**Don't:**
- Harass, insult, or demean anyone
- Gatekeep based on experience or approach
- Spam, troll, or derail conversations
- Share others' private information

## Enforcement

If someone violates this code of conduct, report it to conduct@allin1.app. We will review and take appropriate action, which may include warning, temporary ban, or permanent removal from the community.

## Scope

This applies to all QuantumClaw spaces: GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, Discord, and any other community channels.

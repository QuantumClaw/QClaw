# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics, the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## API Keys Needed

<!-- List any API keys your skills require. Don't put actual keys here.
     Keys go in the encrypted secret store. This is just a reference. -->

```
EXAMPLE_API_KEY=         # What it's for
```

## Custom Skills

<!-- Reference any skills you've built or imported. -->

```
skills/
  my-skill/              # What it does
```

## Platform Quirks

<!-- Things you've learned about specific APIs that aren't in the docs. -->

## Voice Preferences

<!-- If using TTS/STT, note your preferences here. -->

## Connection Notes

<!-- SSH details, server IPs, device names, anything you need quick access to. -->

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.

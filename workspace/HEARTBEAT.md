# HEARTBEAT.md

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat checks.
# Add tasks below when you want your agent to check things periodically.
#
# The agent reads this file during heartbeat polls (default: every 30 min).
# If nothing's here, it replies HEARTBEAT_OK and moves on.
#
# Example tasks:
#
# ## Check inbox
# Check for urgent unread emails. Only flag if something needs attention.
#
# ## Calendar watch
# Any events in the next 2 hours? Remind me 30 min before.
#
# ## Lead pipeline
# Check GHL for new leads added today. Summarise in memory.
